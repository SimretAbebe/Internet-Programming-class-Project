## CS-56 Digital Time Capsule
# Description

CS-56 Digital Time Capsule is a simple multi-page web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows Computer Science classmates to store and revisit memorable classroom moments such as jokes, achievements, challenges, and special events, even after graduation.

## Features

Multi-page website (Home, Memory Wall, My Memory)

Submit memories with optional name or anonymous option

Memory categories (Joke, Roast, Win, Pain, CS Chaos)

Emoji and optional image support

Instant display of memories

## Technologies Used

HTML – Page structure and forms

CSS – Styling, layout, responsiveness, and animations

JavaScript – Events, functions, validation, DOM manipulation, and localStorage

## How It Works

Users submit memories through a form.
JavaScript validates the input, saves the memory locally, and displays it dynamically on the Memory Wall page.

## Purpose

This project preserves class memories in a meaningful digital format while demonstrating core JavaScript concepts and front-end web development skills.
